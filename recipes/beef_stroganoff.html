        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Saute ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat until
                    browned and crumbly; 5 to 10 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>At the same time, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil.
                    Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes.
                    Drain and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>Drain and discard any fat from the cooked beef. 
                    Stir condensed soup and garlic powder into beef. 
                    Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
                </li>
                <li>Remove beef from the heat. Add egg noodles and stir to combine.
                    Stir in sour cream and season with salt and pepper.
                </li>
